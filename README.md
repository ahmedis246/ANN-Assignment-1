# ANN-Assignment-1
# Simple ANN using tanh Activation Function

## Assignment 1

the project implements a simple Artificial Neural Network (2-2-2 architecture):

- 2 Input neurons
- 2 Hidden neurons
- 2 Output neurons
- Activation function: tanh
- Weights initialized randomly in range [-0.5, 0.5]
- Bias values:
  - b1 = 0.5
  - b2 = 0.7

The program performs only the Forward Pass and prints the final output of the network.

## How to Run

```bash
python ann_tanh.py
