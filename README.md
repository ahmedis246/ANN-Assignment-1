# ANN with tanh Activation (Forward & Backpropagation)

## Assignment 1

This implementation includes:

- 2-2-2 Neural Network
- tanh activation function
- Random weight initialization in range [-0.5, 0.5]
- Bias values:
  - b1 = 0.5
  - b2 = 0.7
- Forward propagation
- Backpropagation using gradient descent

The program prints the final network output after training.
